## MinionJS - Getting Started

## Installation

While you don't actually need to install MinionJS to use it, it's recommended, especially if you are developing for a browser-based application. MinionJS provides a very nifty build tool, that you will want to take advantage of.

Grab the latest version of Node.js [here](http://nodejs.org/)

Since Node.js now comes bundled with [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm), you no longer have to install it separately.

Once you have Node.js installed, just do:

	npm install minion-js

Or you can just clone this project via git:

	git clone git://github.com/gigafied/minion.git

If you're gonna be developing inside Node.js, all you need is:

	var minion = require("minion-js");

If you're gonna be developing via the browser, copy the minion.1.4.1.js (or minion.1.4.1.min.js) to a place of your choosing and include it via a  &lt;script&gt; tag.

If you just want to start playing around without installing anything grab the source [here](https://github.com/gigafied/minion/blob/master/dist/minion.1.4.1.js)
(Yep, you only need one lousy .js file!)
