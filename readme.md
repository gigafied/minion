### f0xy - AMD inspired Classy JavaScript

The goal of f0xy is to provide AMD like simple, easy-to-implement inheritance and class support for JavaScript.

f0xy does all this, all while sporting a tiny footprint of 3.1k (or an additional 1.6k if you are already using Modernizr or yepnope in your project).

f0xy was mainly influenced by:

- NamespaceJS: https://github.com/maximebf/Namespace.js
- John Resig's "Simple JavaScript Inheritance": http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/
- The AMD Pattern

### What f0xy brings to the table:

- The concepts of classes + inheritance to JavaScript.
- Namespace management.
- Asynchronous loading of dependencies.
