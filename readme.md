### f0xy - AMD inspired Classy JavaScript

The goal of f0xy is to provide AMD like simple, easy-to-implement inheritance and class support for JavaScript.

f0xy does all this, all while sporting a tiny footprint of 3.1k when minified and gzipped (or 1.6k if you are already using Modernizr or yepnope in your project).

f0xy was mainly influenced by:

- NamespaceJS: https://github.com/maximebf/Namespace.js
- John Resig's "Simple JavaScript Inheritance": http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/
- AMD Pattern: https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD


### f0xy provides:

- Extremely readable and comprehensible code and structure.
- The concepts of classes + inheritance to JavaScript.
- Namespace management.
- Asynchronous loading of dependencies.
