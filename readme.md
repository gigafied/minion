### f0xy - Foxy JavaScript Inheritance


The goal of f0xy is to provide AMD like simple, easy-to-implement inheritance and class support for JavaScript.

f0xy does all this, all while sporting a tiny footprint of 3.1k when minified and gzipped (or 1.6k if you are already using Modernizr or yepnope in your project).
