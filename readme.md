### f0xy - Foxy JavaScript Inheritance


The goal of f0xy is to provide easy-to-use inheritance and class support for JavaScript.

f0xy enables you to easily create and extend custom classes and namespace your classes.

Other Features:

- Singleton Class support
- Static Class support
- Notification system to promote loose coupling (publish/subscribe)

f0xy does all this, all while sporting a tiny footprint of 3.6k (when minified and gzipped).
