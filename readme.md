### xTendJS - Simple JS Inheritance

The goal of xTendJS is to provide simple, easy-to-implement inheritance support for JavaScript.

xTendJS does all this, all while sporting a footprint of 3.1k (or an additional 1.6k if you are already using Modernizr or yepnope in your project).

xTendJS was inspired by NamespaceJS: https://github.com/maximebf/Namespace.js and John Resig's "Simple JavaScript Inheritance": http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/

### What xTendJS brings to the table:

- The concepts of classes + inheritance to JavaScript.
- Namespace management.
- Asynchronous loading of dependencies.
